# **CNN from Scratch with NumPy** 🛠️

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built entirely from scratch using just NumPy!** No external libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch — just good ol' NumPy. 🐍

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This is a complete implementation of a CNN that classifies images, built from the ground up. No shortcuts were taken — each layer, function, and operation was written manually using pure Python and NumPy. The network includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**  
- **Pooling Layers**  
- **Activation Functions** (ReLU, Sigmoid)  
- **Fully Connected Layers**  
- **Backpropagation**  
- **Optimizers** (SGD, Adam)  
- **Loss Functions** (Categorical Crossentropy, MSE)  

### **Why?**

Because I wanted to understand the nuts and bolts of how CNNs work. Also, because *"reinventing the wheel"* sounds fun until you realize it takes forever to train. 

## ⚠️ **Warning**

- Training this model takes *forever* (think hours, tens of hours). 
- My CPU is still recovering.  
- If you value your time, use this as a learning exercise — not as a production model.

## 🌟 **Key Features**

- **Built Everything From Scratch**: Convolution, pooling, backpropagation — it's all written by yours truly.  
- **No Libraries**: Just raw, unfiltered NumPy (and a lot of willpower).  
- **Training**: A work in progress. I managed to train it for about an hour before realizing... maybe it's time to switch to something more efficient. 

## 🚗 **Lessons Learned**

1. **Building from scratch** = great learning experience, but **also very inefficient**.  
2. **NumPy is powerful**, but **not meant for production-level deep learning**.  
3. **Patience** is key — but so is knowing when to *let go* and switch to something faster.

### **Disclaimer**:  
This project is meant for learning purposes and has not been optimized for production. If you plan to train this on large datasets, proceed with caution... and possibly invest in a supercomputer :P
